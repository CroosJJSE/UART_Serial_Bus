# UART_Serial_Bus
Developed a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) serial communication module, which allows for data transmission and reception between devices using serial communication protocols. we did this to connect FPGA with PC to be used in Processor design.

there are 4 states in the statemachine 
- IDLE
- START
- DATA
- END
